# Create Stunning 3D Building Height Maps with Google Open Buildings

Welcome to my repo! We're diving into the exciting, newly released Google Open Buildings Temporal dataset, packed with detailed info on building presence and height across Central and South America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. 

In this repo, you'll learn:
1. How to access this rich dataset via Google Earth Engine.
2. Filter data by confidence interval estimates.
3. Merge it with Google Open Buildings Polygons.
4. Create stunning 2D and 3D building maps using `ggplot2` and `rayshader` in R.

This code will help you create a crisp 2D map of building height in downtown Mumbai.
